Survivaria is a unique mod that adds in multiple new survival mechanics, tons of new items and more.

Features:

Hunger - One of the 2 main resources in the mod, decreases slowly over time and gives increasing negative effects as it gets lower. The better food you eat the more hunger it will restore and the better bonuses you recieve.

Thirst - The other main resource in the mod, also decreases slowly overtime and faster in hot environments, also gives more negative effects as it gets lower. Drinking more revitalizing drinks keeps you refreshed for longer and gives better effects.

New food items - Over 100+ new foods and drinks to eat, the more time you spend making better meals the better the bonuses are. Don't slack on your diet!

New crafing stations and survival items - A handful of new stations which assist in creating better food. Also don't forget your handy survival items that assist you in many ways!
